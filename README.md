# MSc Course Project – Interactive WebGIS Tool

This repository contains my MSc course project in WebGIS at Lund University.  
The project focuses on developing an **interactive WebGIS application** using **OpenLayers**.  
The tool was designed to allow users to explore **protected natural areas**, add their own observations as points, lines, and polygons, swipe between satellite imagery and background maps, and export custom maps.

## 📂 Structure
- `src/` – JavaScript and HTML files implementing the WebGIS functionality with OpenLayers  
- `data/` – Example datasets and configuration files used during the course  
- `docs/` – Project report (PDF) explaining background, methodology, and implementation details  

## ⚠️ Note
The map layers were hosted by Lund University under my student ID.  
Since the course has ended and the student account was removed, the hosted layers are no longer available and the WebGIS tool does not function as originally intended.

## 🔧 Features
- Visualization of protected nature areas  
- User‑generated observations (points, lines, polygons)  
- Swipe functionality between satellite imagery and background maps  
- Map export/print functionality  

## 🎓 Context
Originally developed as part of the MSc course in WebGIS at Lund University.  
The project was intended as an educational exercise in building interactive map applications with OpenLayers.
